<h1>hello</h1>
<p>
I'm currently a freshman at Yale University studying the intersection between digital manipulation and aspects of art. I lived in Los Angeles for a while, though I have a particular love for my hometown of Wuhan and the Chinese culture. This blog is where I'd like to share some of my thoughts on the arts and popular culture, as well as some pieces of my (honestly very spontaneous) writing. If you'd like to find out more about the interesting personality I never knew I had, you can check out my <a href="https://www.law-wang.com">Portfolio</a> or click on one of those social media thingys on this page.
