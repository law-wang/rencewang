<h1>hi there</h1>
<section>
I'm a student at Yale (attemtping to) studying the intersection between digital manipulation and art. 
<br>
I love my hometown, Wuhan, my adopted hometown, Los Angeles, Chinese poetry and several other things that are too basic to list out.
<br>
My <a href="https://blog.law-wang.com">blog</a> is where I share my thoughts on the world and popular culture (because I love my opinions and proselytizing them!), as well as my (honestly very spontaneous) writing. 
<br>
If you'd like to find out more about the interesting personality I never knew I had, you can check out my (insufficiently updated) <a href="https://www.law-wang.com">portfolio</a> or click on one of the other social media link thingys on this page.
