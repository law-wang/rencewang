hi I'm a student at Yale (attemtping to) studying the intersection between digital manipulation and art. I love making playlists on Spotify, Chinese poetry and TV shows, crying to YouTube videos, and several other things that are too basic to list out. My <a href="https://blog.law-wang.com">blog</a> is where I share my thoughts on the world and popular culture (because I love my opinions), as well as my (honestly very spontaneous) writing. If you'd like to find out more about the interesting personality I never knew I had, you can check out my (insufficiently updated) <a href="https://www.law-wang.com">portfolio</a> or click on one of the other social media link thingys on this page.
