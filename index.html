<h1>hi there</h1>
<section>
I am a student at Yale (attemtping to) studying the intersection between digital manipulation and art. I'm from Los Angeles, but I also immensely love my hometown of Wuhan and the Chinese culture. This is where I'd like to share some of my thoughts on the world and popular culture (because I love my opinions), as well as my (honestly very spontaneous) writing. <font size="6">If you'd like to find out more about the interesting personality I never knew I had,</font> you can check out my <a href="https://www.law-wang.com">Portfolio</a> or click on one of those social media thingys on this page.
